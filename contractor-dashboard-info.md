📌 Objective: Create a streamlined contractor workflow that allows for instant meeting creation, lead generation, project setup, task management, payment structuring, and final approval submission—all in a fast and intuitive process.

🔹 Contractor Flow Breakdown
1️⃣ Instant Meeting Creation & Lead Generation
📍 Goal: Allow contractors to instantly create a meeting, share a link, and convert the discussion into a structured lead.

✅ Button on Main Dashboard: "Create Instant Meeting"
✅ Clicking the button automatically generates a meeting room link.
✅ Contractors can copy & share the link via email or SMS.
✅ Customers must sign in or create an account before joining.
✅ Once the meeting is finished, a lead is automatically generated based on:

Customer-provided details upon sign-in.
AI-processed meeting notes & project type detection.
Automatically categorized project (e.g., Kitchen Remodel, Bathroom Upgrade).
📍 Outcome: A structured lead is instantly created, requiring minimal manual input.

2️⃣ Lead Auto-Populates with a Customizable Project Template
📍 Goal: As soon as a meeting concludes, a structured lead automatically generates with an editable project template.

✅ Project Type Recognized by AI (e.g., Kitchen Remodel, Bathroom Addition).
✅ Prebuilt Process Template Auto-Populates:

Standard project tasks appear in an editable checklist.
Contractors can quickly modify, remove, or add new steps.
✅ Timeframe & Cost Entry Fields for Each Task:
Contractors assign labor, materials, and timeframe for each step.
✅ Milestone-Based Payment Setup:
Payments can be assigned per task, per phase, or custom intervals.
📍 Outcome: The contractor doesn't have to start from scratch—just modify and confirm.

3️⃣ Sharing & Refining the Project with the Customer
📍 Goal: Ensure that once a project is structured, it can be shared with the customer for review, selection completion, and communication.

✅ First Share Automatically Updates the Customer's Dashboard.
✅ The customer receives:

Full Project Overview (Tasks, Timelines, Milestones).
Selections List (Materials & Products Needed).
Messaging & Communication Channel for clarification.
✅ Contractors Can Add Required Selections:
Certain materials must be chosen by the customer before finalizing the quote.
✅ Real-Time Messaging System:
Customers & contractors can discuss changes, make decisions, and finalize quotes efficiently.
📍 Outcome: A real-time, interactive process where customers can make decisions while the contractor fine-tunes the details.

4️⃣ Submitting the Quote for Customer Approval
📍 Goal: Once all decisions are made, the contractor submits the final quote for customer approval.

✅ Once all selections & pricing are finalized:

The contractor clicks "Submit for Approval."
✅ Customer receives the finalized quote in their dashboard.
✅ Customer can either approve or request minor changes.
✅ Once approved, the lead is converted to an active project.
📍 Outcome: A smooth transition from lead to managed project, reducing unnecessary steps.

5️⃣ Lead → Project Conversion & Management
📍 Goal: The approved project now shifts into an active task-tracking and milestone management workflow.

✅ Contractor can now manage:

Task status updates (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
Payment verification for milestone-based payments.
Communication & updates between contractor and customer.
✅ Customers see live updates in their dashboard.
✅ Any change orders follow the same seamless process.
📍 Outcome: A fully interactive contractor-customer workflow that eliminates friction and streamlines project execution.
