# 🚀 Qwillo Customer Dashboard – Post-Shopping Experience & Contractor Collaboration

## 📌 Objective
Create a seamless, clean, and dynamic dashboard where customers can:
- ✅ View selected products from the custom store
- ✅ Communicate directly with the contractor
- ✅ See the full contractor-generated quote (including materials & labor)
- ✅ Track tasks and project progress in an easy-to-follow campaign-style format
- ✅ Make quick product adjustments without overwhelming choices
- ✅ Maintain a super clean, intuitive UI that mirrors the stakeholder (contractor) side

## 🔹 Step 1: Customer Dashboard Layout & Overview
**📌 Goal:** Keep the interface simple, dynamic, and intuitive, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

### 🛠 Core Sections of the Dashboard
#### ✅ Project Overview Panel (Top Section)
- 🔹 Displays Project Name, Customer Name, & Contractor Name
- 🔹 A large, clear project status indicator (e.g., "Awaiting Finalization," "In Progress," "Completed")

#### ✅ Product Selections Panel (Linked to Store for Adjustments)
- 🔹 All selected items from the store are displayed in a clean, scrollable view.
- 🔹 Customers can click on any product to edit or replace it, taking them back to the store without disrupting the dashboard experience.

#### ✅ Quote Breakdown Panel (Totals in a Smooth UI)
🔹 Three Simple Sections:
1. Products (Individual Selections from Store)
2. Materials (Defined by the Contractor)
3. Labor (Shown as a total, not broken down per item)

📍 Labor is only shown as one total value (contractors don't want to display individual labor costs).

#### ✅ Contractor Communication & Notes Section
- 🔹 Live Chat or Message Threads for direct interaction with the contractor.
- 🔹 Customers can ask about selections, request changes, or discuss timelines.

## 🔹 Step 2: Dynamic Task & Project Progress Tracking
**📌 Goal:** Show customers what's happening in real time, keeping them engaged and informed.

### 🛠 Campaign-Style Task Presentation
- ✅ Tasks are visually presented in a "progress tracker" format (similar to a campaign board).
- ✅ Customers see tasks as milestones, each with a status:
  - Not Started
  - In Progress
  - Completed
- ✅ Tasks dynamically update based on contractor-side actions so customers always know where their project stands.

📍 **Example Tasks for a Kitchen Remodel:**
- 🔹 "Demolition & Removal" → (Completed ✅)
- 🔹 "Cabinet Installation" → (In Progress 🟠)
- 🔹 "Countertop Installation" → (Not Started ⚪)

✅ Customers cannot modify tasks but can see updates in real time as the contractor progresses.

## 🔹 Step 3: Seamless Adjustments & Easy Navigation
**📌 Goal:** Allow customers to easily adjust their selections without confusion or unnecessary steps.

### 🛠 Product Adjustments via Store Integration
- ✅ Every selected product includes a small "Edit" button, linking back to the store.
- ✅ Customers can swap items without disrupting the quote-building process.
- ✅ Updated selections sync automatically in both the customer & contractor dashboards.

📍 **Example: If a customer wants a different countertop:**
1. Click "Edit" on the countertop selection
2. Taken directly to the Countertops Store Section
3. Select a new option
4. New selection instantly updates in the dashboard

## 🔹 Final UI Considerations
- 🔹 Do NOT overwhelm the customer with unnecessary choices.
- 🔹 Keep the UI as clean and structured as the contractor's side.
- 🔹 Ensure quick & easy navigation between product selections and the final quote.
- 🔹 All updates are dynamic and sync between customer & contractor dashboards.
